# Minigames Collection with PHP, HTML5, CSS and JS

---

The repository contains a collection of maintained browser based minigames which can be implemented in other projects. The sub projects are created with *PHP* as backend, and tries to use modern *HTML5* APIs. Designs are not exactly emphasized and room for improvement/customization is kept. Front end *JS* mostly uses *AJAX* calls to interact with the backend game engines.


### Security and Usage

There is no consistent Database for the games. All game data is handled by PHP Sessions.However, databases can be implemented easily if needed. The aim of the project is to have a collection of HTML5 games but with a backend. Use at your own risk.

### Current Collection
